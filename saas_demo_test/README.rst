================
 SaaS Demo Test
================

This addon is not meant to be used.

Roadmap
=======

* Auto-testing: we will need to check that template is created. Once it's done, be sure that there is a note in usage insturctions which says that the tests can be run with a pre-written path to the test repository in `addons path`, because we cannot reload the odoo in order to update `addons path`
