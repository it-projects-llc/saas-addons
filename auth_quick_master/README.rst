=======================
 Quick Auth (Master)
=======================

Authentication provider for ``auth_quick`` module.

Allows users from group ``Quick authentication for builds`` be authenticated as any user from the build. Access levels to builds can be extented in a custom module.

How it works
============

Base idea is similar to OAuth protocol.

* User is authenticated in master odoo database (where this module is installed)
* User opens url in the build (where ``auth_quick`` module is installed): ``build-123.example.com/auth_quick/login?build_login=admin`` (authentication via ``?build_user_id=1`` is also supported). This module doesn't provider UI with such links and has to be implemented via another module depending on your needs.
* Build redirects User back to master odoo with build reference
* Master odoo creates record in model ``auth_quick_master.token`` with fields

  * ``user_id``
  * ``build``
  * ``build_login``
  * ``build_user_id``
  * ``token``

* Master odoo redirects User back to the build with new url: ``build-123.example.com/auth_quick/check-token?token=abcdf456789``
* Build validates the token by sending direct request to Master odoo and initialize session if token is valid
